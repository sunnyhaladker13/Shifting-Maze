## ðŸŽ¯ Gameplay

### Objective
Collect as many gems as possible while navigating the maze. The maze walls gradually close in, adding pressure to your journey!

### Features
- **Dynamic Maze** that shrinks over time, adding strategy and urgency
- **Challenging Enemies** with unique behaviors:
  - Chasers (pink) - Actively pursue the player
  - Wanderers (purple) - Move randomly through the maze
- **Power-ups** to help your adventure:
  - Speed boost (green) - Move faster for a limited time
  - Invincibility (yellow) - Enemies can't hurt you temporarily
  - Ghost (blue) - Pass through walls for a short duration
- **Visual Effects** including particle systems and glow effects
- **Responsive Controls** with smooth movement

### Game Mechanics
1. The maze is procedurally generated using a randomized depth-first search algorithm
2. Outer walls close in periodically, creating a more challenging playspace
3. When all gems are collected, a new batch appears
4. Score increases with each gem collected
5. The game ends when an enemy catches you (unless invincible)
